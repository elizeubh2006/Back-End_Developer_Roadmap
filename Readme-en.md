# Back-End Developer Roadmap

## Description
This roadmap diagram was created for beginner programmers who want to follow the path of a Back-End Developer in .NET and aspire to become architects or senior programmers. The roadmap is ordered by dependencies and project phases, following the logic of scaling and covering all possible back-end development scenarios.

## Project Status
This roadmap is still under development, and I will soon share each sub-topic in detail. I am also working on a course with questions and answers and study material. Suggestions are always welcome.

## Access to the Roadmap
You can access the roadmap through the following link:

## Motivation
This roadmap is the result of much study and experience, covering everything that is required in job vacancies in this area. It focuses exclusively on .NET, as it is my specialty, and including other areas would make the map impossible to fit on one screen.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
